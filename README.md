# PCA
## Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction using PCA

This repository contains Python code for dimensionality reduction and visualization of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The aim is to facilitate the visualization of high-dimensional data in a two-dimensional space to observe patterns and potentially aid in cancer diagnosis prediction.

### Dataset
- The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is sourced from scikit-learn's `load_breast_cancer` module.
- It consists of features related to breast cancer tumors and corresponding diagnosis labels.

### Usage
1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
2. **Running the Code**: Execute the provided script in your preferred Python environment.
3. **Understanding the Code**: Comments are provided within the script for better understanding of each step.
4. **Data Visualization**: The scatter plot generated using Matplotlib depicts the reduced dataset in two dimensions, with points colored based on diagnosis labels.

### Steps Involved
1. **Loading Dataset**: Load the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset and explore its structure.
2. **Creating DataFrame**: Features are loaded into a DataFrame for further processing.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Standardize the features to ensure uniform contribution to the analysis.
4. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the standardized dataset to two principal components.
5. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the reduced dataset in a scatter plot to observe patterns and potential clusters.
